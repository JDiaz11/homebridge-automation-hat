# homebridge-automation-phat
> Project to integrate a Pimoroni Automation (p)HAT on a Raspberry Pi Zero W with Apple's Homekit using Homebridge


This is the code for a basic homebridge plugin and a python server. By running both on a [Raspberry Pi 0W](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-wh-with-pre-soldered-header) with the [Automation HAT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/automation-hat) installed you can add a relay as a switch to your Homekit and control it with Siri. 

Obviously the Automation HAT is capable of much more and this project is a good start for more abitious home automation projects. Remember don't use the Automation HAT to directly switch mains electricity!

```
5. move or copy the ```config.json``` file into your ```home/pi/.homebridge``` folder.
6. Make sure flask is installed 
```sudo pip3 install flask```
7. use npm to install the homebridge plugin globally 
``` npm install -g ~/homebridge-automation-hat```
8. Restart homebridge 
9. start the server ```python ~/homebridge-automation-hat/server.py```

## Usage example

I have connected some Led light strips with a music sensitive controller to my automation phat's relay. I've put them up in my shed, and with an Apple homepod and iphone I've set up a siri shortcut to play a playlist and turn the lights on when I say "Hey Siri, disco shed!!'
